# Next.js FCM Chat App
This project is a simple chat application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to handle push notifications. It demonstrates how to request notification permissions, get a unique FCM token for a device, and receive push notifications from the Firebase Console.

#### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [your_repository_url]
cd [your_repository_name]
```
#### Install project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

#### Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.
